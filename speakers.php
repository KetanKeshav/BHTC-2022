In 2016,she started her journey with ethically made paper. She went to Kumarappa National Handmade Paper Institute in Jaipur and learnt how to turn cotton rags and waste, from the textile industry, into paper. Empowered with that knowledge, she started Bluecat Paper. 
Bluecatpaper produces sustainable handmade paper and paper products. The paper produced is upcycled and recycled without cutting down a single tree. They use the pulp of cotton rags, linen rags, coffee husk, banana fiber, mulberry, corn husk, elephant poo, bagasse, vetiver grass, ragi, tea waste, and flax fiber to name a few. They also manufacture handmade paper products for home, gifting, and packaging. Their products are 100% environment-friendly. She finds exciting synchronicity between nature, plant fiber, and papermaking.</div>
