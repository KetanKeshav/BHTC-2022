                        <p>
                          After finishing her Bachelor's degree in Commerce from St Joseph's in Bengaluru in 2000, she worked at the Internationale Nederlanden Groep (ING) Bank.
                          <br>
                          In 2016,she started her journey with ethically made paper. She went to Kumarappa National Handmade Paper Institute in Jaipur and learnt how to turn cotton rags and waste, from the textile industry, into paper. Empowered with that knowledge, she started Bluecat Paper.
                          Bluecatpaper produces sustainable handmade paper and paper products. The paper produced is upcycled and recycled without cutting down a single tree. They use the pulp of cotton rags, linen rags, coffee husk, banana fiber, mulberry, corn husk, elephant poo, bagasse, vetiver grass, ragi, tea waste, and flax fiber to name a few. They also manufacture handmade paper products for home, gifting, and packaging. Their products are 100% environment-friendly. She finds exciting synchronicity between nature, plant fiber, and papermaking.

                          After 26 plus years in Technology Leadership spanning Electric Vehicles, Networking, Telecommunications, Datacenter Infrastructure and Cloud Services, I am pursuing avenues to give back to the student and engineering community as a Mentor and Public Speaker.

                          My day job is as a technology leader at Nutanix on next generation Hybrid Cloud Distributed Manageability by leveraging the goodness of IoT, DevOps and ML. My passion for applying Technology across domains in battling Climate Change helped me disrupt the Electric Mobility space at SUN Mobility by delivering the world’s first Unified Software IoT Edge Compute Platform for Electric Vehicle Li-Ion Battery Swapping and Charging for Electric Buses, Electric Scooters and Electric Rickshaws. This is currently deployed in production/trials in India and Sri Lanka.

                          In addition to the above, I have had the pleasure of being at the heart of many key technology developments, innovations and disruptions, some of which are listed below:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Cisco – Technology leadership in the development of the Serviceability platform for next generation DevOps enabled Webex Teams, the global market leader for Cloud based Video-Voice Conferencing.</li>
                          <li>DELL – Technology leadership in the development of the iDRAC Embedded Data Centre Server Controller with Web Services, an industry first.</li>
                          <li>Infinera – Engineering the distributed Management Plane for DWDM Optical Switches</li>
                          <li>Hughes Networks – Technical Lead for the first Online Distance Learning portal via VSAT Satellite Networks</li>
                          <li>IBM – Software Engineer for the world’s first 10 channel DWDM Optical Multiplexer network management offering</li>
                        </ul>
                        My “night-job” is to follow my passion for Mathematics, Physics, Space and Earth Sciences, the Human Impacts of Climate Change, the importance of Ethics and Values in Education and Society to name a few.
